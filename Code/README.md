A reservoir computing model of reward-modulated motor learning and automaticity.
Neural computation, 31(7), pp.1430-1461.

This repository contains MATLAB and Python implementations of the models presented in the  abovementioned paper.

The MATLAB implementation was provided by the authors of the original paper.
The Python re-implementation has been submitted to [ReScience C](https://rescience-c.github.io/),  in collaboration with Nicolas Thou, Nicolas Rougier and Arthur Leblois.

#### Contents

2 directories:-

- `MATLAB implementation`:  This directory contains the scripts provided by the authors of the original paper (with minor structural alterations by us), along with the results of simulating the models on various tasks.

- `Python implementation`:  This directory contains the scripts for our Python adaptation of the models presented in the original paper. It contains two sub-folders. One, the direct adaptation in Python, and two, the Python re-implementation with modifications to improve the robustness and scalability of the models. The results of simulating these models on various tasks are available in these sub-folders, for comparison.
